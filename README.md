# Amazon Homepage Replica  

This project is a **replica of the Amazon homepage** created using only **HTML and CSS (Flexbox)**.  
It is a static project that focuses on the layout and design, not on functionality like the real Amazon website.

## ðŸ”¹ How I Built It  
1. Created the **HTML skeleton** with sections like header, banner, and product boxes.  
2. Used **Flexbox properties** (`display: flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, `flex-wrap`) to arrange content.  
3. Styled each section (header, banner, categories) with CSS for background, padding, and spacing.  
4. Tested layout in browser to ensure design looks close to Amazon.
